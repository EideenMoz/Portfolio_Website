Where to find images?
    - Stock photography: photos that can be licensed for specific uses 
        - Unsplash
        - Lorem Picsum (placeholder images)
    - Icons: small graphics used to add visual interest (such as naviagation elements or social media links)
        - Iconfinder

Optimizing images for the web
    - Resize large images to improve website speed
    - Large size dimensions are used for print (such as 4000px x 3000px)
    - Files should be as small as possible for the web 

Pixel Density 
    - The number of pixels contained within a physical area of a screen 
    - Measured in pixels per inch (PRI)
    - Higher pixel density = more pixels = sharper images and text 
        - Adobe Express and ShutterShock used for resizing images

Relative Paths 
    - Used to link to files located within the same project 
    - The path is determined by the file's loaction in the directory
    i.e.
        <a href="resume.html"></a>
        <img src="images/thumbnail.jpg">
    - File paths are case-sensitive

Absolute Paths 
    - Used to link to external web resources 
    - The path uses the full URL, including the protocol (https), domain name, director, and file name 
    i.e.
        <a href=\"https://website.com\"></a>
        <a href=\"https://website.com/posts/\"></a>
        <a href=\"https://website.com/posts/page.html\"></a>

Avoid Hotlinking
    - Hotlinking: embedding web resources (such as images) from other websites into your own website 
    i.e.
        <!-- link to an external website -->
        <a href="https://notmywebsite.com"></a>

        <!-- hotlinking -->
        <img src="https://notmywebsite.com/images/photo.jpg">

Referencing CSS: Inline, Internal, and External

Inline CSS 
    - The inline method uses a style attribute added to the opening HTML tag
    i.e.
        <p>Default black text.</p>
        <p style="color: red;">Red text.</p>        
        <p style="color: red;">Red text.</p>        <!-- Each tag needs its own style attribute for inline CSS -->
        <p style="color: red; font-size: 12px; background: #333;">Multiple styles.</p>

    - Overrides style rules added by other methods
    - Should be used sparingly, if at all 
    - This method is difficult to maintain

Internal CSS
    - CSS is added to the head section of the HTML document
    - All the CSS style rules are enclosed between style tags 
    - CSS selectors can then be used to apply styles to all the matched elements, instead of each element individually
    i.e. 
        <head>
            <style>
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>This is a red paragraph</p>
            <p>This is another red paragraph</p>
        </body>

    - To style multiple pages, the same block must be added to each page 
    i.e. 
        <!-- index.html file -->
        <head>
            <style>
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
            </style>
        </head>

        <!-- resume.html file -->
        <head>
            <style>
                p {
                    color: red;
                }
            </style>
        </head>

External CSS
    - Involves using a separate file for the CSS which is referenced in the HTML file using the link tag 
    - The link tag is a void HTML element so it doesn't need a closing tag 
        - It's also included in the head section of the document 
    i.e. 
        <head>
            <title>page title</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
        </head>

    - An external stylesheet can be shared among multiple HTML files in the project by linking to the same CSS file
    - Any changes made to the stylesheet will be applied to all the HTML pages it's linked to 
    i.e.
        <!-- index.html file -->
        <head>
            <title>Home Page</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
        </head>

        <!-- resume.html file -->
        <head>
            <title>Home Page</title>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css">
        </head>

    - Recommended method 
    - Separates the CSS from the HTML 
    - Reusable and easier to maintain
