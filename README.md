# First_Website_Portfolio
 This repo includes the source files for my first website, a portfolio guided by the LinkedIn Learning course CSS Essential Training. The repo will continue to be updated as I build on front-end development skills. The repo includes my notes from the learnings as well. 

This website was deployed using GitHub Pages https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
