# First_Website_Portfolio
 This repo includes the source files for my first website, a portfolio guided by the LinkedIn Learning course CSS Essential Training. The repo will continue to be updated as I build on front-end development skills. The repo includes my notes as well, titled Chapter_Notes. The portfolio folder is where the source files for the project are.
