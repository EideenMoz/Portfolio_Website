# First_Website_Portfolio
 This repo includes the source files for my first website, a portfolio guided by the LinkedIn Learning course CSS Essential Training. The repo will continue to be updated as I build on front-end development skills. The repo includes my notes, as well, in the _Notes_ folder, titled CH_Notes. The _personal-site_ folder is where the source files for the project are.
